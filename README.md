Hi!
My name is Chenchu.
I am a 18 year old college dropout.
I am crazy about learning and exploring new things.
I am a BIG fan of Science and Technology, besides Math and Programming.
I am a Great lover of Photography and Film making.

P.S
I started a Start-up kind of a platform that connects Local Repair Shops and people who are looking for repair services!
I am learning Web Development, Photography, and Film making.
